Why FastAPI?

You can create an API fast(duh!). Apart from that.
 - [Data Validation] You define the type of all of the data that your API is expecting. You have to set the validations explicitly otherwise(traditionaly). Fastapi automatically sends you error messages in case of such errors
 - [Auto Documentation] Auto documents your entire API. Generates a webpage with this info
 - [Auto Completion and Code Suggestions] Better completion in IDEs as we are already defining types

Pre-requisite:
- `pip install fastapi`
- `pip install uvicorn` (Uvicorn lets us run the API as a webserver

What is an Endpoint?
Point of entry in a communication channel when 2 systems are interacting
baseURL/endpoint
Examples:
- /hello
- /get-item
- localhost/form
  - localhost is the baseURL when we are hosting locally
- facebook.com/home
